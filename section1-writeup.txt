In this penguin dataset, we found that the average body mass of the penguins is approximately 4201.75 grams,
and the average bill length is around 43.92 mm. This suggests that there may be a correlation between body mass and bill length,
which could indicate that penguins with longer bills tend to have higher body masses. Additionally, when examining the species
and bill depth, we observed that Adelie penguins have an average bill depth of 18.35 mm. This highlights potential variations
in bill characteristics among different species.
